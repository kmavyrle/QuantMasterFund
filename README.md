# QuantMasterFund
 My strategy library for quantitative trading algorithms.
 
 Recommended Set-Up:
 1. You will need an FX brokerage, any will do
    
 3. Metatrader5 (code is implemented in mql5 not mql4)

 5. VPS (you can use MQL5's provided VPS, costs about $100 USD per half-year) or use contabo

 7. Drag algo onto a chart e.g USDJPY and select the desired timeframe. Plenty of resources on youtube to run algos on mql5
